# ðŸ©´ - Haikus by Joey

This is a demonstration of Southern Cross AI's large language model JoeyLLM.  Specifically, this demonstration allows you ask JoeyLLM to write you a haiku of your choosing.

## Basic Setup (from Vercel) ðŸŒ¿

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or an alternative, which is stated once you run these commands) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Use ðŸ¦˜

Enter a prompt of your choosing in the following window:

After it has generated, you can scroll below to find your generated haiku:

You can also click the text below to copy your new haiku:

## What is the purpose of this? ðŸ’¥

This demonstration showcases how JoeyLLM can be prompt-engineered to reach a certain objective, and how successful it is in filling said objective.  This was also just for fun because I like haikus.
